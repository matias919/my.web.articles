            <h1>The Disappearence of Lars Mittank</h1>
            <p>
               On July 8, 2014 a German man named Lars Joachim Mittank disappeared in Varna, Bulgaria. He was on vacation with his friends in Bulgaria, and got involved in a fight with four other men. His ear drum  was ruptured in the fight, and he was unabled to fly back to Germany with his friends.<br><br> He rented a room from a hostel in a poor area in Varna,  Bulgaria. He was seen behaving oddly on the hostel's  security cameras, only spending one night at the hostel. He had called his mother to cancel all his credit cards  and that four men were following him, threatening to kill him. His mother then booked him a flight back to Germany  for the following day.<br><br>
 Lars Mittank was seen on airport security cameras entering  the airport with his luggage. Later he was seen sprinting out of the airport, without his luggage, jumping over a  fence. Eyewitnesses told seeing him running into the nearby forest, which was the last time he was seen. What do you  think really happened to Lars Mittank?<br><br>

            <h1>The Incident at Dyatlov Pass</h1>
            <p>
                On February 1, 1959, nine ski-hikers went to the Ural                     mountains, what is now Russia. The group set up a camp on                 the slope of Kholat 
                Syakhl, that is now named Igor Dyatlov, the name of the                   groups leader. Something mysterious had happenad to them, 
                because they never returned.<br><br>Searchers were sent to
                find the missing group. After many days of searching, on 
                February 26, searchers found the ski-hiker's abandoned 
                camp sight, where their tent was <em>ripped open from the
                inside.</em> Footprints were found, that led to the near
                by woods, where the first two bodies were found, with
                only underwear on. The other seven bodies were found later.               First they were thought to have died from hypothermia, but
                when the bodies were inventoried by medical examiners, the
                evidence made no sense. Some of the bodies had radioactive
                clothes on and some had signs of physical trauma, one body
                had third-degree burns, one was missing a tongue, and 
                another was missing both eyes. One body had a fractured
                skull and another had been vomiting blood.<br><br> There are many 
                theories of this mystery. One of them is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrasound"                       >infrasound</a>
                , wich is a real phenomenon, that can cause fear in humans. It's still unknown what happened that night to the nine ski-hikers.

            <h1>The Mighty Battleship Yamato</h1>
            <p>Japan coudn't build large fleets of ships against
            the United States, so they decided to build larger
            ships, that could attack many ships at once. The new
            larger ships were called the Yamato-class.<br><br>
            The first battleship of the Yamato-class was the                  mighty Yamato. She was launched on August 8, 1940,
            and was named after the Yamato province. She was 256 
            meters long, but her sister the Musashi was larger.
            <br><br>
            The construction of the Yamato in Kure was kept in
            secret and hidden from spies. If one of the workers 
            told someone about the project, they could have faced 
            a  death sentence.<br><br>
            The Yamato weighed in total 72,800 tons, and her 
            armor weighed in total 22,534 tons, almost 
            one-third of the ships weight. She was outfitted
            with nine 18.1-inch guns on three turrets. The largest
            and most powerful ever mounted on a warship. The turrets weighed 2,774 tons, and the guns 
            had a range of 25-miles (40-km). The Yamato had the 
            largest amount of artillery mounted on one ship.
            Her armor varied from 8-inches to 16-inches thick, 
            and her gun turrets were protected with armor ranging
            from 9.5-inches to 26 inches thick.
            She had a hangar , which could store 3 to 4 aircraft,
            that were launched by two catapults.<br><br>
            Her four steam engines could produce a power of
            150,000 SHP. Her top speed was 27 knots (50 km/h).
            <br><br>
            The Yamato was enver a part of a major battle, but the
            battle of Leyte Gulf she saw her first big action. She
            hit a Aemrican aircraft carrier from a distance of 
            20-miles, with her 18.1-inch guns.<br><br>
            The Yamato faced her fate on April 7, 1945, when she 
            was met by 400 American aircraft. She withstood the 
            bombs, that were dropped on her, but she was finally
            sunk by 19 American aerial torpedoes, drowning 2,498
            of her crew. The end of the Yamato was, when her her
            forward internal magazines detonated. The result was 
            a large explosion. In the incident 3,063 of Yamato's
            3,332 crew members were killed. Even though the Yamato
            sunk, she is still one of the greatest battleships of
            all time.

            the United States, so they decided to build larger
            ships, that could attack many ships at once. The new
            larger ships were called the Yamato-class.<br><br>
            The first battleship of the Yamato-class was the                  mighty Yamato. She was launched on August 8, 1940,
            and was named after the Yamato province. She was 256 
            meters long, but her sister the Musashi was larger.
            <br><br>
            The construction of the Yamato in Kure was kept in
            secret and hidden from spies. If one of the workers 
            told someone about the project, they could have faced 
            a  death sentence.<br><br>
            The Yamato weighed in total 72,800 tons, and her 
            armor weighed in total 22,534 tons, almost 
            one-third of the ships weight. She was outfitted
            with nine 18.1-inch guns on three turrets. The largest
            and most powerful ever mounted on a warship. The turrets weighed 2,774 tons, and the guns 
            had a range of 25-miles (40-km). The Yamato had the 
            largest amount of artillery mounted on one ship.
            Her armor varied from 8-inches to 16-inches thick, 
            and her gun turrets were protected with armor ranging
            from 9.5-inches to 26 inches thick.
            She had a hangar , which could store 3 to 4 aircraft,
            that were launched by two catapults.<br><br>
            Her four steam engines could produce a power of
            150,000 SHP. Her top speed was 27 knots (50 km/h).
            <br><br>
            The Yamato was enver a part of a major battle, but the
            battle of Leyte Gulf she saw her first big action. She
            hit a Aemrican aircraft carrier from a distance of 
            20-miles, with her 18.1-inch guns.<br><br>
            The Yamato faced her fate on April 7, 1945, when she 
            was met by 400 American aircraft. She withstood the 
            bombs, that were dropped on her, but she was finally
            sunk by 19 American aerial torpedoes, drowning 2,498
            of her crew. The end of the Yamato was, when her her
            forward internal magazines detonated. The result was 
            a large explosion. In the incident 3,063 of Yamato's
            3,332 crew members were killed. Even though the Yamato
            sunk, she is still one of the greatest battleships of
            all time.
